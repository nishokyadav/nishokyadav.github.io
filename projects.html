  <li><b>Computer Communication Networks</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a cloud-based social network utilizing the Dropbox and Google Drive APIs</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This was developed using Python.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Principles of Operating Systems</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented matrix multiplications using threads</li>
      <li>Developed a family tree visualization program using process spawning and termination</li>
      <li>Programmed a producer/consumer environment where each required access to a semaphore in order to become active</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These were all implemented in C.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented and visually represented the path planning algorithms A*, &#952*, and visibility graph search</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This was developed using C++.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Implemented and visually represented a particle based filter</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This was programmed using Python. The wxWidgets library was used for creating a clean display window.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Game Development Pipeline</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented a game engine including graphics, input, physics, entity, and network managers</li>
        <ul> 
          <li>The game engine was developed using Python and the Python-Ogre rendering system.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Developed a 3D version of the board game Battleship that allows two players to play against each other over a network</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This game was developed using the above game engine.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Introduction to Game Development</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed "Christmas Cannon," where an elf is launched out of a cannon and randomly generated powerups and obstacles determine how far the elf can travel</li>
      <li>Created "Wrath of the Elements," where the player can swap control between four elemental characters, each containing unique abilities, so that the specified character collects its amulet and the end of each level.</li>
      <li>Implemented "Pok&#233mon Defense," a tower defense game possessing a Pok&#233mon theme.</li>
      <li>Implemented a "Space Wars" style game while adding some new abilities and weapons to make the game unique</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These were all developed using the GameMaker development tools. The focus of this course and these projects was to create games incorporating a unified theme, eye-catching visuals, and realistic physics.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Structures</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Programmed a basic computer vision techniques to detect the number, size, and orientation of objects in an image</li>
      <li>Implemented and debugged image modification techniques including: scaling, rotating, reflecting, cropping, translating, and combining two images by adding/subtracting them</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These projects were implemented in C++.</li>
        </ul>
