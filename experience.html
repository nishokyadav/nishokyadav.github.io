<h2>Software Engineering Intern</h2>
<p>Since October 2013, I have been employed at Bally Technologies Inc. as a Software Engineering Intern. My primary responsibilities have been to assist the game development and operating system teams through the testing of many slot games. I have tested the reliability of the operating systems by modifying configurations of bets and checking that they are in line with the expected outcome. I have also worked to make sure that the games can be used on multiple jurisdictions. Using an FTP server, I was able to test for the New York jurisdiction whether or not certain games could be downloaded over the network onto new hardware. I have improved my communication ability by working with members of the development teams to solve many problems that have arisen.</p>

<h2>Grader</h2>
<p>For the Fall 2013 semester, I was the grader for Dr. Sushil Louis for the course CS 482-Artificial Intelligence. My duties included grading the programming assingments and the midterm exam. I also held office hours to assist students if they needed help.</p>

<h2>Mobile Engineering Education Lab (<a href="http://www.unr.edu/engineering/research-and-outreach/k-12-outreach/me2l">ME2L</a>)</h2>
<p>Between November 2012 and October 2013, I was employed with ME2L as a student instructor. The purpose of the ME2L program is to educate young students, typically in elementary or middle school, about engineering in an attempt to inspire interest in joining an engineering field in the future. A typical lesson would be comprised of teaching a 30-40 minute lesson on an engineering topic followed by a 15-20 minute exercise where the students get to experience engineering principles. After teaching the lesson, my role would be to help the children connect what we just taught them to the exercise they are working on. This job taught me excellent teamwork and communication skills, as well as improved my ability to explain complex concepts in a simple way so that my audience could understand the topic.</p>

<h2>Evolutionary Computing Systems Lab</h2>
<p>During my sophomore year of college, between November 2011 and May 2012, I worked as a student intern for Dr. Sushil Louis in his research lab. My project was to take an AR Drone and control it using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. This was done by taking an open-source project that allowed a pc to control the drone and using the Microsoft Kinect API to create body positions that activate different movements of the drone.
