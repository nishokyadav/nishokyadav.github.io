<h2>Professional Interests</h2>
<p>My goal is to obtain a career in the video game industry as either a game designer or game engineer. I have played many, many games since my childhood and many of them have become major parts of who I am. Although I hope to work in the video game industry, I am very passionate about all techonology in general. My belief is that techonology exists to enhance the lives of the people that use it.</p>

<h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
<h3>Event Administrator, Nevada eSports, UNR</h3>
<p>My duty as an Event Admin was to ensure that our video game tournaments, which were held twice a semester, ran smoothly. These tournaments have around 120 participants along with 1000+ spectators (including live spectators and viewers of online stream). At the tournament, I would be doing tasks including: managing the player room to ensure games started punctually, troubleshoot problems that occur with peripherals during a match, operating the check-in desk and taking registration fees, and assisting with setup and takedown of the venue.</p>

<h3>Family Head, Nevada Circle K, UNR</h3>
<p>Circle K International is the most widely known collegiate service organization. They are a part of the Kiwanis organization, which includes Key Club in high school. I was a general member for my first two years in the club and went to various service and social events. As a Family Head in my third year with the club, I was assigned a "family" within the club. This family included 10 other members of the club. My duty as a family head was to encourage my "children" to participate in more events with the club and to foster friendships with them all. Although I was not the most active member of the club, I got to know many of my family members relatively well. A couple of them even gave me the nickname "Legen-daddy," since our family was the Legen-wait for it-dary family based on the tv show <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>.</p>

<h2>Other Things I Enjoy</h2>
  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  <p>I have enjoyed playing video games ever since I received my GameBoy Color as a child. Video games for me are what other people use books for. When I am playing a game it takes me to an entirely different world where I get to interact with the characters and participate in the story. My favorite games include: League of Legends, God of War 3, Tomb Raider (2013), The Last of Us, Pok&#233mon Silver/Y, FIFA 14, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and Star Wars: Battlefront 2.</p>
  <h3>Star Wars</h3>
  <p>I really, really wish I could use the Force.</p>

  <h3>Marvel</h3>
  <p>Iron Man is awesome. If you make me an Iron Man suit, I would love you forever &#9829;</p>

  <h3>Recreational Sports</h3>
  <p>I played soccer for about 8 years. I played keeper for the first 4 or 5 years, but after I dislocated my shoulder doing that I switched to playing the field; I was probably best at defender. Once I got to college, I stopped playing soccer pretty much altogether and occasionally play racquetball with my friends.</p>
